    <p><b>For hundreds of years, humans have been interested in the possibility of artificial intelligence, long before
            Alan Turing asked the crucial question: “Can machines think?” The concept of “nonhuman intelligence” traces
            back
            to ancient Greek philosophers. The concept of robots goes back to the Renaissance.</b> </p>
    <p><b>In our modern age, AI is everywhere. It’s in how we navigate transportation, how we communicate, and where we get
        our entertainment, just to name a few. And AI continues to grow, becoming a more integral part of modern
        societies by the day. Companies invest billions of dollars into the development of more advanced AI.</b></p>
    <p><b>As a business, it can be confusing to navigate the ever-evolving world of AI. You want to be on the cutting edge,
        but don’t know exactly where to start. That’s why we created this complete guide. <br>This blog covers a range

        The original definition of AI, defined in 1955 by John McCarthy, one of
        the original creators of the
        field, was
        pretty broad and all-encompassing: “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines.”

        A slightly more modern definition of AI is: a broad branch of computer science concerned with creating machines
        that can learn, make decisions, and perform tasks to a human-like level. Advanced AI machines can learn and grow
        on their own, independent of human intervention. Even basic AI can handle complex tasks that would normally need
        a human touch but may need the help of a programmer to learn from its mistakes and improve.

            width="100%" height="500px"> <br>At
        the most basic level, AI functions by taking in data and using an iterative
        processing system and
        different
        algorithms to learn from patterns found in the data, and then react to it in a specific way. Advanced AI can
        also measure its own performance each time this sequence runs and start iterating and improving its own
        performance.

        AI systems use something called the propensity model to make predictions based on the data it processes, and
        then use those predictions to respond to or initiate actions.

        Different types of AI run off different baseline AI algorithms, which make them react and learn in different
        ways. Some do simple tasks of categorizing data or making predictions. Some do much more complex tasks, such as
        driving a car without a human at the wheel.

        <center><h1>Types of AI</h1></center>
        <img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Types-of-Artificial-Intelligence.png"
            alt="AI" width="100%" height="450px"> <br>There are four main types of AI, and each type is defined based
        on how much data it can
        store, and how
        it uses that data. Some cannot store data at all and can only react to the stimulus directly in front of it.
        Some can store a limited amount of data. Some have the ability to store much data and use it to improve.

        Of the four types of AI that are established, at present, the last two are simply theoretical. Researchers and
        programmers are still working toward achieving those levels.

        The four types of AI are: <ul>
            <li>Reactive</li>
            <li>Limited Memory</li>
            <li>Theory of Mind</li>
            <li>Self-Awareness</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p id="four">
        <center><h1>Algorithms</h1></center>
        <img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Artificial-intelligence-algorithm.jpg"
            alt="AI" width="100%" height="500px"> <br>All AI programs run off of varyingly complex algorithms that
        determine how they react in
        certain
        situations. Some
        simple algorithms allow AIs to categorize data, some allow them to make a series of decisions based on stimulus
        data, and some allow them to learn and grow.

        An algorithm is a series of rules that a calculation or operation must follow in order to be completed
        correctly. This applies to math and computer programs. Of course, math algorithms are usually simpler than an AI
        program algorithm. AI algorithms work by taking in training data to learn and then completing its tasks. As
        previously mentioned, some can also measure their own progress and improve independently.

        <img src="https://fronty.com/static/uploads/examples_og_ai.jpg" alt="AI" width="100%" height="500px"> <br>In
        our modern day and age, AI is everywhere. Businesses use it in production lines, analytics,
        reports,
        and more. Consumers use it to navigate, search for things, and make their lives easier. But many people may not
        even realize they’re using AI.
        A few common examples of AI include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Digital assistants (Siri, Alexa, etc.)</li>
        <li>Self-driving cars</li>
        <li>Navigation apps</li>
        <li>Social media algorithms</li>
        <li>Advertisements </li>

            alt="AI" width="100%" height="500px"> <br>As of this article’s publication (2022), AI is a part of everyday
        life for businesses and
        consumers.
        People of
        all kinds interact with AI every day, either through social media, online shopping, search engines, or in other
        places.

        Businesses of all sizes use AI to help streamline and give them a leg up. And businesses that don’t need to
        start thinking about it, or risk being left behind as the technology continues to evolve.

        <center><h1>History</h1></center>

            width="100%" height="300px"> <br>So how did we get here, with AI touching our daily lives every day?
        Contemplating robots and
        self-driving cars as a part of everyday life, instead of out of science fiction?

        As mentioned in the introduction, the idea of fake intelligence isn’t new. It dates back hundreds of years. But
        it wasn’t until the 1900s that the idea became more reasonable to scientists. Even as early as 1921, playwrights
        were writing about robots, and scientists contemplated the idea of computers being able to think on their own.
        But the work on what turned into modern AI didn’t begin until 1950.

        There’s a ton of work that went into AI between 1950 and the current time (2022), but here is a high-level
        overview:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>1950-1979: </b>Important AI questions were asked. The first programming language for AI was created.
            Basic AI
            programs that could answer questions or sort data were made. The first example of an autonomous vehicle was
            created.</li>
        <li><b>1980-1987: </b>The first AI boom. Breakthroughs in AI research led to increased funding, which led to
            more
            breakthroughs. Conferences on AI were held for the first time, and commercial AI came onto the market.</li>
        <li><b>1987-1993: </b>A stagnation in AI research led to the first AI winter. Private and public investors
            halted their
            investments, convinced AI was a fad and wouldn’t go anywhere. Of course, AI researchers continued to work
            regardless, just with fewer resources.</li>
        <li><b>1993-2011:</b> New breakthroughs led to more AI funding. The first AI system beat a human world champion
            at
            chess. The first Roomba hit the market. Nasa landed rovers on Mars, and the first digital assistant (Siri)
            was released by Apple.</li>
